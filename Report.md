# Project 1 Report

Answer the following prompts directly in this file:

* What each of the 5+ attributes of your dataset represent 

  *The class on this project is the readings of a wind turbine. The attributes of each object are: sample ID number, date,     time, the active power output of the turbine, wind speed, theoretical power output, and wind direction. Hence each object 
  describes the conditions at which measurements were taken for a wind turbine.*
  
* Where you got the data from.

  *The data was downloaded from Kaggle.*
  
* Why you chose that dataset.

  *I chose this dataset because my major is mechanical engineering and we are currently learning in class how wind 
  turbines are built and how they work. I believe that it is a good compliment to solidify my understanding, of the concepts 
  and also learn how to use coding as a tool for future projects.*
  
* How the rows are ordered by default (i.e. is the data sorted by a particular column?).

  *The data is sorted out by date and time. All the measurements taken correspond to January, so they are sorted out by day 
   1-31 and then the time of day from 0:00 to 23:59.*
  
* How you know your functions work correctly.

  *The getDataFromFile function is known to work correctly because it can be visualized as an ordered table in the         
  console. The result from the operation done with the data was corroborated using an Excel spreadsheet and the function of 
  mean in Excel as well as manual operations done on cells. The result yielded the same answer meaning that functions are 
  working correctly.*
  
* Why you chose that calculation for your dataset.

  *I chose these calculations because I consider that it is a meaningful value for the dataset. Knowing the percent power 
  output with respect to the theoretical power output may allow the engineers handling the turbine to think of adjustments 
  that can be made to the turbine to make it more efficient.*
  
**Note: Any code that was not authored by yourself or the instructor must be cited in your report. This includes the use of concepts not taught in lecture.**
